# Time-Series-Classification-for-Human-Activity-Recognition

### Abstract

Human activity recognition is the problem of classifying sequences of accelerometer data recorded by specialized harnesses or smart phones into known well-defined movements. (Download link: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones))

Classical approaches to the problem involve hand crafting features from the time series data based on fixed-sized windows and training machine learning models, such as ensembles of decision trees. The difficulty is that this feature engineering requires strong expertise in the field.

Recently, deep learning methods such as recurrent neural networks like as LSTMs and variations that make use of one-dimensional convolutional neural networks or CNNs have been shown to provide state-of-the-art results on challenging activity recognition tasks with little or no data feature engineering, instead using feature learning on raw data. Approximate accuracy is about %88 to %92 in this method.

### Dataset Description

NOTE : PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE DATASET AND STORE THEM IN THE CORRECT PATH BEFORE RUNNING THE PROJECT

The data was collected from 30 subjects aged between 19 and 48 years old performing one of six standard activities while wearing a waist-mounted smartphone that recorded the movement data. Video was recorded of each subject performing the activities and the movement data was labeled manually from these videos.

The six activities performed were as follows:

* Walking
* Walking Upstairs
* Walking Downstairs
* Sitting
* Standing
* Laying

The movement data recorded was the x, y, and z accelerometer data (linear acceleration) and gyroscopic data (angular velocity) from the smart phone, specifically a Samsung Galaxy S II. Observations were recorded at 50 Hz (i.e. 50 data points per second). Each subject performed the sequence of activities twice; once with the device on their left-hand-side and once with the device on their right-hand side.

The raw data is not available. Instead, a pre-processed version of the dataset was made available. The pre-processing steps included:

* Pre-processing accelerometer and gyroscope using noise filters.
* Splitting data into fixed windows of 2.56 seconds (128 data points) with 50% overlap.Splitting of accelerometer data into gravitational (total) and body motion components.

Feature engineering was applied to the window data, and a copy of the data with these engineered features was made available.

A number of time and frequency features commonly used in the field of human activity recognition were extracted from each window. The result was a 561 element vector of features.

The dataset was split into train (70%) and test (30%) sets based on data for subjects, e.g. 21 subjects for train and nine for test.
